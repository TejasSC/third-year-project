HOW TO PLAN THE DEMO

Beginning (0:00 to 1:30):
- Project title
- Explain project
-- Analysing a static image's visual properties, converting those to
musical attributes
- Cover tools used to build it
-- Why Processing? Why Java?
(Software sketchbook and language
Coding in a visual arts context
Open source
Many contributors build tools and libraries
Allows development of:
Computer vision
Networking
Electronics programming
Music composition
And more...)

DEMO (1:30 to 9:30)
Demo for the following images: technopark, you, the good place, purple flowers
- load an image into the system
Image 1:
- Explain the histogram stuff first on the left
-- Hues
-- Saturations
-- Brightnesses
Image 2:
- Modify HSB Values, show changes
Image 3:
- Talk about chromesthesia
Image 4:
- ControlP5

- Coding chromesthesia: mapping hues/colours to instrument sounds in melody

TECH (9:30 to 17:00):
- Follow power point

CLOSING (17:00 to end)
Evaluation feedback:
- Pros: functionality, idea, music makes sense
- Cons: UI (improved on it, ongoing process)

Future aspirations:
- make it a web app so that ppl don't have to be in person to test it
- Multiple genres of music
- possibly include object detection APIs to map objects to sounds...?
