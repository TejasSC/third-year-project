HOW TO PLAN THE DEMO

Beginning:
- Project title
- Explain project
-- Analysing a static image's visual properties, converting those to
musical attributes
- Cover tools used to build it
-- Why Processing? Why Java?
(Software sketchbook and language
Coding in a visual arts context
Open source
Many contributors build tools and libraries
Allows development of:
Computer vision
Networking
Electronics programming
Music composition
And more...)


Demo for the following images: you, the good place, purple flowers, short kings
- load an image into the system
- Explain the histogram stuff first on the left
-- Hues
-- Saturations
-- Brightnesses
- Modify HSB Values, show changes


- Coding chromesthesia: mapping hues/colours to instrument sounds in melody

TECH:
- Go through top down structure design

Evaluation feedback:
- Pros: functionality, idea, music makes sense
- Cons: UI (improved on it, ongoing process)

3 things I planned to work on at the beginning of this semester:
1) Improve the UI with Control P5, allowing file selection of an image via .jpg
or .png file extensions.
2) Expand on genres able to chosen for this project, e.g. have Western classical
music and rock, as well as the current genre of lo-fi chillhop.
3) For the current genre of lo-fi chillhop, work on making results sound more
musically coherent, as in more metronomical according to the tempo of the drum
beat obtained.
-- got 1 and 3 done, 2 can wait for future iterations of project
-- don't stop developing this bc it is fuccin SiCk

Future aspirations:
- make it a web app so that ppl don't have to be in person to test it
- Multiple genres of music
- possibly include object detection APIs to map objects to sounds...?
