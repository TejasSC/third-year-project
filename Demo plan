HOW TO PLAN THE DEMO

Method:
- load an image into the system
- Explain the histogram stuff first on the left
-- Hues
-- Saturations
-- Brightnesses
- Start changing the HSB values and stuff to demonstrate the musical
effect changes too
- THEN, load another image and show that whole process again
