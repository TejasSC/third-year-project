Representations of RGB colour mode: HSL, HSV
HSV colour model: Hue, Saturation, Value
HSL = Hue, Saturation, Lightness
- Hue = dominant colour as perceived by observer
- Value = chromatic notion of intensity

- Brightness = how much light is emitted from a certain area
- Lightness = brightness relative to brightness of a similarly illuminated
white

HSL: used when actually changing
HSB: used when selecting a certain colour

- Satuaration = the colorfulness of an area in proportion to its brightness
-- THEREFORE, it measures how far away the colour is from gray
-- THEREFORE, fully saturated colours exist around a circle of lightness value
0.5 in HSL model, (0 for fully black, 1 for fully white)
-- Exists independently of lightness in HSL colour space (i.e. both light and
dark
colours can be heavily saturated in HSL)
-- Saturation reduced by more white-tinting in HSV, but in HSL it DOESN'T change

- HSV: cylindrical coordinate representation of points in RGB color model
- Saturation = radius (shorter radius gives more white/ess saturation, less
white/
more saturation of colour within hue when radius increases)
- Value = height (0 is lowest brightness, 1 is highest brightness)
- Hue = slice&angle range from red (0 deg base)

- Computerphile method of doing this whole thing:
-- Each pixel's rgb with luminosity values: Red rhythm, green octave, blue note
within octave, luminosity loudness
-- Try this approach, it might change things dramatically
